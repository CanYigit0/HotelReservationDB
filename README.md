# HotelReservationDB
Hotel Reservation Database.Designed an SQL database for a mock hotel chain that allowed for tracking room reservations, guests, room information and various amenities.
First, you have to have a solution stack. I suggest you to download "ampps" (https://www.ampps.com/). 
After installing ampps, you need to download this code and move it to the "ampps install directory"/www/. (for ex: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ampps\www").

Project specialities:
All districts and cities of Turkey should be held in a csv file and imported to the appropriate tables
with install action.
500 random Turkish Names and 500 random Turkish Surnames are to be held in a csv file and their
combinations of 1620 full names should be inserted into the CLIENT table.
● You should have 5 different ROOM types.
● You should have different prices for different room types.
● You should define 10 different hotels.
● You should have 5 different facilities in total and every hotel should have at least 2 facilities.
● Every city should have 5 different randomly chosen hotels.
● You should have 10 different travel agencies.
● Finally for every client, you should have at most 5 booking information with install action.

Button A:
After choosing the city from the select box and the start - end dates from the date picker,
you should show for each hotel, how many rooms are booked between these dates. You should write
a PHP file (can be named as FilterHotelsByCityDate.php) for these selecting and showing actions.
