# HotelReservationDB
Hotel Reservation Database
First, you have to have a solution stack. I suggest you to download "ampps" (https://www.ampps.com/). 
After installing ampps, you need to download this code and move it to the "ampps install directory"/www/. (for ex: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ampps\www").

Project specialities:
All districts and cities of Turkey should be held in a csv file and imported to the appropriate tables
with install action.
500 random Turkish Names and 500 random Turkish Surnames are to be held in a csv file and their
combinations of 1620 full names should be inserted into the CLIENT table.
● You should have 5 different ROOM types.
● You should have different prices for different room types.
● You should define 10 different hotels.
● You should have 5 different facilities in total and every hotel should have at least 2 facilities.
● Every city should have 5 different randomly chosen hotels.
● You should have 10 different travel agencies.
● Finally for every client, you should have at most 5 booking information with install action.

Button A:
After choosing the city from the select box and the start - end dates from the date picker,
you should show for each hotel, how many rooms are booked between these dates. You should write
a PHP file (can be named as FilterHotelsByCityDate.php) for these selecting and showing actions.

Button B:
(i) Click on a room type button to see which room type has been booked how many times.
(ii) Click on an agency button to see how much money agencies’ made from the booked rooms.
(iii) Click on a choose agency button, when an agency of that hotel is chosen, you should show all the
booking information of that agency for the selected hotel.
(iv) After clicking on the invoice button choose the client who booked room(s) in that hotel, then
show his/her room information, booking price, booked date, start and end date, and total cost of the
vacation.
